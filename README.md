# ID1020AlgorithmsAndDataStructures

These assignments were done for the course "Algorithms and Data Structures" (ID1020) at KTH (Royal Institute of Technology), between 
and October 2015. 

## PascalsTriangle

This is an implementation of Pascal's Triangle. There is a recursive version, an iterative version and a reqursive version with better
performance than the first version. 

## BubbleSort
